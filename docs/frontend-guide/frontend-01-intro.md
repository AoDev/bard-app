# Introduction: Clean Frontend Architecture

There are infinite ways to build frontend and software in general. Thus the solution to a maintainable architecture is not in the details but in a solid foundation built from a simple and small set of guidelines that are easy to keep in check.

**You can always fix a bug in a library, but a bad architecture will turn your entire project into Hell.**

**A clean architecture tries to divide the entire system in layers and entities that have their own responsibility.**

> Simpler is better. Less is more.
