# Accessibility and Design

Simple steps from design to code. For designers, product managers and frontend developers who care about accessibility in their apps.

## Did you know?

_Typography_ has been studied for centuries: effective communication is key to achieve success.

But, _"I can read it, so it's fine"_ is a usual comment in apps development.
Everyone's vision is different and all screens aren't the same. Thus, the meaning of "readable" from a person's point of view is subjective.

In fact, a lot of people have vision problems.

Have you ever seen how some people have literally their nose on their mobile in public transports?

* In the US, nearly 4.2 million people over age 40 have a visual impairment. Among those 40 and older, more than 2.9 million have low vision and 1.3 million are legally blind.

* Approximately 8% of men and 0.5% of women among populations with Northern European ancestry have the most common form of color blindness that makes it hard to see red or green.

As developers we can make our user's life easier. That said, it is not only about accessibility. A UI carefully designed with accessibility in mind is pleasant to use for everyone.

## Accessibility Guidelines and AIM tools

Instead of using our own perception, we can rely on the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

> "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is developed through the W3C process in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, with a goal of providing a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally."

## What is an "AIM color"?

AIM stands for "Accessibility In Mind". (https://webaim.org/)

An "AIM color" is meant to ensure that from a *Contrast* and *Font Size* point of view, a text will be readable in your application.

### The WCAG 2 "Contrast Ratio"

> "In WCAG 2, contrast is a measure of the difference in perceived "luminance" or brightness between two colors (the phrase "color contrast" is never used). This brightness difference is expressed as a ratio ranging from 1:1 (e.g. white text on a white background) to 21:1 (e.g., black text on a white background)..." [https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/](webaim.org)



## Using the Contrast Checker tool

When designing, you can use the [Contrast Checker Tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

As you will see, there are different levels of accessibility: AA and AAA.
How far you want or need to go is up to you. I recommend to at least pass the WCAG AA for large Text.

This applies not only to text, but to the UI icons as well.
